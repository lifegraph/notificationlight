**What youâ€™ll learn:** How to create a device that lights up when you get a new notification on Facebook

**What you'll need:**
* [A WiFly Module](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10822) ($35)
* [An Arduino](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021) ($30)
* An LED
* A resistor (~500 ohms)

## Prerequisites

Completed the [hardware tutorial](https://github.com/lifegraph/hw-tutorial) and have a set up Arduino that can talk to the internet. 

## Making HTTP Requests

We'll be using [WiFlyHQ](https://github.com/harlequin-tech/WiFlyHQ) as our library for interfacing with the WiFly module. The setup of the library is covered in the [hardware tutorial](https://github.com/lifegraph/hw-tutorial).

We'll also be using the [Lifegraph Arduino library](https://github.com/lifegraph/arduino-lifegraph) along with the WiFlyHQ library. The Lifegraph library allows us to easily use Facebook's API without having to worry about properly formatting HTTP requests ourselves. The library also gives us a way to process the data that Facebook sends back to us.

In order to install the library, you'll need to:

1. [download the zip file here](https://github.com/lifegraph/arduino-lifegraph/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip the file
3. Rename the folder from arduino-lifegraph-master to Lifegraph
4. Put the folder where the rest of your Arduino libraries are. This is probably underneath `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries`
5. Restart the Arduino IDE

Now open the Arduino IDE and you should see the Lifegraph library as an option when you go to Sketch -> Import Library

## The Arduino

Wire up the LED in series with the resistor betweein Pin 13 and the ground pin of the Arduino.

Then open up `notificationlight.ino` from the [notificationlight example in this repo](https://github.com/lifegraph/notificationlight/blob/master/notificationlight/notificationlight.ino). You'll need to change the network name and the password to work with your Wifi network

```ino
const char mySSID[] = "your_ssid";
const char myPassword[] = "your_password";
```

## Authentication with Facebook

We'll also need an authentication token from Facebook in order to get the right notification information. For a temporary access token, follow the 1 hour auth instructions. There's also a Facebook proxy at [lifegraphconnect.com](http://www.lifegraphconnect.com) that will allow you to have 2 month tokens.

### Single user, temporary access token

1. Go to the Graph API Explorer: [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer) and request a token.

2. ask for "manage_notifications" permissions.
3. copy that auth token
4. These tokens only work for 1 hour so they should only be used for testing.

### Multiple user, physically-linked access token

1. Go to [lifegraphconnect.com](http://www.lifegraphconnect.com) and log in
2. Find the Notification Light tutorial and allow access to it. The app needs your Facebook notification information to work.

3. Click on the "View Token" button to view your auth token

4. Copy the auth token

## Setting up your auth token

After you get your access token, you'll need to stick it in the `notificationlight.ino` as well:

```ino
const char access_token[] = "...";
```

Save the code and then load it up onto an Arduino.
